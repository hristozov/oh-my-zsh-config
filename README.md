# oh-my-zsh config
Not very elegant, but useful. On my box.

Features:
* SVN status (branch, rev, whether it's dirty) in the prompt
* grunt submodule included
* modified Gentoo theme (similar to the original Bash prompt)
* [git lg](https://coderwall.com/p/euwpig) support

## Usage
```bash
ZSH_THEME="forkbomb"
plugins=(git grunt mvn npm node ruby rvm sublime svn)
```
