# oh-my-zsh config
Not very elegant, but useful. On my box.

## Features
* SVN status (branch, rev, whether it's dirty) in the prompt
* grunt submodule included
* custom theme (based on the Gentoo them, which is itself similar to the original Bash prompt)
* [git lg](https://coderwall.com/p/euwpig) support
* various other minor tweaks

## Usage
```bash
ZSH_THEME="forkbomb"
plugins=(brew git grunt mvn npm node osx rails ruby rvm sublime svn vagrant)
```
